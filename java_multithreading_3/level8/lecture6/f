Even when i hate you
i can't unlove you baby.
let me go,
i am not an iron doll.
stop trowing me away
and picking up like there's no yesterday.
i can't withstand this pain
and yet i am an addict
i'll love you till the end
my only wish
is that
you one day will love me back.


i'm living in a story
it neither good or bad.
i don't pretend to be sorry
i don'tr lie at all.
